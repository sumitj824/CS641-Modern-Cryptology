"This is another magical screen. And this one I remember perfectly...
	
Consider a block of size 8 bytes as 8 x 1 vector over F_{128} --
constructed using the degree 7 irreducible polynomial x^7 + x + 1
over F_2. Define two transformations: first a linear transformation 
given by invertible 8 x 8 key matrix A with elements from F_{128} and 
second an exponentiation given by 8 x 1 vector E whose elements are 
numbers between 1 and 126. E is applied on a block by taking the ith 
element of the block and raising it to the power given by ith element in E.

Apply these transformations in the sequence EAEAE on the input block
to obtain the output block. Both E and A are part of the key.

You can see the coded password by simply whispering 'password' near
