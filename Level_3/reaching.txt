You take some mushrooms in your hand and put it in the hole.
Someone grabs the mushrooms from your hand! You then hear
chomping sound as if they are being quickly eaten. After
a while, the sounds cease ...

You figure that perhaps some rat is sitting inside the hole
eating mushrooms. Suddenly, you hear a squeaky voice
speaking from inside the hole!

"Oh, thank you very much for the mushrooms! I have been hungry
for so long!! I am a poor spirit trapped inside this hole by an
evil man. Maybe you can help me be free ... (sigh) oh, forget
it. I'll help you pass this chamber though. Speak out the magic
words ``thrnxxtzy'' for the hidden door to become visible. The door
lies hidden in the main chamber."
